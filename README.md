Proposed Direction:
Enhance the workflow to dynamically compare the current GCP secrets state with the intended Terraform-managed list. This will:
	•	Automatically reconcile deleted or recreated secrets.
	•	Remove dependency on manual variable updates.
	•	Provide a more automated, scalable, and consistent secrets management process.
